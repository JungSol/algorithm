You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. <br/>
Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. <br/>
You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Note:** You can assume that <br/>
0 <= amount <= 5000 <br/>
1 <= coin <= 5000 <br/>
the number of coins is less than 500 <br/>
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer <br/>
